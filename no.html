    <div class="letter">
        <p>Baeeeeeee,</p> 
        <p>You're my safe space, my happiness, and the best thing that has ever happened to me. I know it gets hard with the distance and my terrible mood swings but just know I'm sooooo grateful to have you and to call you mine😌.</p>
        <p>I know this isn't much, but I'll do better next time okayyy😔. I'm trying my best to be a better girlfriend, just don't get tired of me okayy.. and if there's anyway I'm lacking just tell me okayyy. I know there's not much I can do for you and I can't promise you the world (obviously), but I promise you all of me. I'm all yours and I've always got your back, no matter what. I love you ml❤️</p> Ermm I decided on CP as a gift. Dunno if that's okay.</p>
        <p>PS: Every day with you is special, but today, I just want to remind you that you are loved beyond words. You're stuck with me forever, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>Hope to see you soon😔🫂</p>
